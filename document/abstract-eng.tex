%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In populations living in poverty, one of the aspects that tends to be neglected is a balanced diet. This is due to various factors, among them the difficulty in planning a nutritious diet that adapts to their economic limitations. Despite efforts by the government and various entities to ensure adequate nutrition for this vulnerable population, problems related to malnutrition and nutritional imbalances continue to affect a significant percentage of the population.
\\
\\
One of the factors that aggravates this situation is the lack of knowledge of basic nutrition principles and the lack of accessible tools to design food plans that take into account both individual nutritional needs and budget constraints. In response to this, the proposed project proposes the creation of an accessible system for the generation of healthy diets at minimum cost with personalized economic and nutritional considerations. The proposed solution aims to provide a practical and easy-to-use tool that allows people to design diets that meet their essential nutritional needs, optimizing available resources, and promoting an improvement in their quality of life.
